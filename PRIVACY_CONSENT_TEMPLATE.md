## Amanuensis Therapy Assistant - Client Consent Form

**Therapist Name**: ________________________________
**Client Name(s)**: ________________________________
**Date**: ________________________________

### About This Technology

Your therapist uses Amanuensis, a secure desktop application that assists with therapy session documentation and analysis. This form explains how the technology works and requests your consent for its use in our sessions.

### What Amanuensis Does

**Recording**: With your permission, sessions are recorded using:
- A microphone that captures the therapist's voice
- System audio capture that records client voices during telehealth sessions
- Dual-channel recording for speaker identification in couple/family therapy

**Transcription**: Audio recordings are sent to OpenAI's Whisper service to create written transcripts with speaker identification (e.g., "[THERAPIST]:" and "[CLIENT]:").

**AI Analysis**: Transcripts are analyzed using Anthropic's Claude AI to provide insights such as:
- Key emotional themes discussed
- Suggested follow-up questions
- Therapeutic opportunities and interventions
- Communication patterns and relationship dynamics

### Data Security and Privacy

**Local Storage**: All recordings and transcripts are stored locally on your therapist's secure computer - never in the cloud.

**Encryption**: Your data is protected using military-grade encryption with password protection.

**API Processing**: While audio and text are temporarily sent to AI services for processing, they are not stored or used for training by these services.

**Data Retention**: Your therapist will follow standard clinical data retention policies. You may request deletion of recordings at any time.

**Access Control**: Only your therapist has access to recordings, transcripts, and AI analysis.

### Your Rights

**Voluntary Participation**: Use of this technology is entirely voluntary. You may decline without affecting your treatment.

**Opt-Out Options**: You may:
- Request traditional note-taking instead of recording
- Allow recording but decline AI analysis
- Request specific portions not be recorded
- Ask for recordings to be deleted

**Review Access**: You may request to review any recordings, transcripts, or AI analysis of your sessions.

**Questions and Concerns**: You may ask questions about this technology at any time.

### Clinical Use

**Supplemental Tool**: AI insights supplement, but never replace, your therapist's clinical judgment and expertise.

**Professional Oversight**: Your therapist reviews all AI analysis before incorporating insights into treatment planning.

**Treatment Focus**: This technology is designed to enhance therapeutic outcomes by helping identify important themes and opportunities for deeper exploration.

### Consent Agreement

Please initial each section you agree to:

**_____ Basic Recording**: I consent to audio recording of therapy sessions using the Amanuensis system as described above.

**_____ AI Transcription**: I consent to having recordings transcribed using AI technology (OpenAI Whisper) with speaker identification.

**_____ AI Analysis**: I consent to having transcripts analyzed using AI technology (Anthropic Claude) to generate therapeutic insights.

**_____ Data Storage**: I understand that recordings, transcripts, and analysis will be stored securely on my therapist's local computer system.

**_____ Multiple Clients** (if applicable): In couple/family therapy, I understand that all participants' voices will be recorded and analyzed, with speaker identification to distinguish between family members.

### Withdrawal of Consent

I understand that I may withdraw my consent at any time by notifying my therapist. Withdrawal of consent will not affect any treatment already provided, and my therapist will continue to provide quality care using traditional documentation methods.
